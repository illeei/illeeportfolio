      <h1>Blocbox</h1>
      <p>At a time where digital information and inspiration is readily available and accessible to virtually anyone, users need a way to store content in a simple and efficient way. Blocbox lets you collect, save and share data and access them in different devices.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>More and more users are saving content gathered online and also writing notes and finding inspiration on the go. Most users, however, are finding it hard to organise all these information. They can’t keep up with which device they save things on, can’t share content easily and just forget that they even saved anything and the information just gets lost and buried in their devices.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Blocbox (See it live here!) is a straightforward, no frills repository for all your content. It lets you create simple notes, add images and save links and access them across your devices. Blocbox also makes it easier for users to share content and collaborate with others.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>There are 3.7 Billion Internet Users today, 50% of which use their mobile phones to access online content and according to a recent study 25% of adults ages 18-44 cannot remember the last time they did not have their device right next to them. It’s pretty safe to assume that there is very little time that people do not have internet access. We are bombarded with digital information all the time and people are always brainstorming on the go. The team at Blocbox aims to find a way to organize all the information we wish to keep and be able to come back to them at a later time. </p>
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>TWe gathered participants with varying backgrounds and surveyed their browsing and device habits. 100% of participants own a smartphone and 93% use this device to browse online 93% of participants own a laptop and 87% use it to browse online. Almost all of the participants consume social media while more than half also browse for news and videos.</p>
      <p>All users save content that they find interesting with varying frequency. Most users make use of their browser to bookmark them. There is also a relevant number of users who use bookmarking sites and their social media to save content for later. Some users take screenshots to save in their devices while some use regular pen and paper simply because it sits on their desk and they are reminded of the content they wanted to return to.</p>
      <p>Users respond well to systems that are quick and easy to use but majority agree that organizing their saved content is a problem. A good number also say that they save content but then forget to look at them again. From this research, we have created 3 User Personas for this project. </p>
